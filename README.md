### Research Goal: Causality Assessment in Dementia and/or Breast Cancer

Methods from machine learning and AI have extremely powerful data modelling in the last years.

The goal of this project is to use **interpretable** methods/models to find and assess causality between non-medical features and target features i.e. diagnosis - this would be the column *CDR* (Clinical Dementia Rating) for the dementia dataset, and *diagnosis* for the breast cancer dataset. 

At center of this project is the **storytelling**. Using the right kind of models, and more importantly visualizations of the data and results, in order to communicate our insights aptly.
